Interactive Help
================

You go on to your gas and electricity supplier's webpage to find a phone number to ring the company about a problem you are having with your supply.

Many companies interactive voice systems ask you a few questions to "direct you to the correct department", wouldn't it be great that as you answer these questions help appears on your screen specific to these problems.
